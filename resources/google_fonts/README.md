# Google Fonts

This directory contains code to package Google Fonts for Synbols. We perform the following:
* Download font files from the Google Fonts GitHub repository
* Rename the fonts with a `synbols-` prefix to avoid overwriting user fonts at installation time
* Package the fonts into a zip archive

The typical user should not need to use this code, since a link to the pre-packaged fonts is provided.
